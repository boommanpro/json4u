<h2>AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS</h2>
<p>We are JSON For You (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;).</p>
<p>We operate the website https://json4u.com (the &quot;Site&quot;), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the &quot;Legal Terms&quot;) (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
<p>You can contact us by email at support@json4u.com.</p>
<p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (&quot;you&quot;), and JSON For You, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the &quot;Last updated&quot; date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.</p>
<p>All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Legal Terms prior to you using the Services.</p>

<p>These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>Informal Negotiations</p>
<p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a &quot;Dispute&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Disputes&quot;) brought by either you or us (individually, a &quot;Party&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Parties&quot;), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States, Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.</p>
<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p>Restrictions</p>
<p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>
<p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

CERTAIN US STATE LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.

But few sites provide BigInt comparison, text comparison, in-line comparison, array difference comparison, so I made JSON For You to address it.\",\"a_why_build2\":\"After two years of use, I found that JSON For You is good enough to process JSON data, but it is not convenient to view JSON data. For example, when encountering a complex JSON structure, JSON For You can quickly view the formatted text, but only the text form can't let developers quickly understand the JSON structure. Therefore, I have launched JSON For You 3.0.0, which provides two view modes: graph view and table view. For complex object type data, you can quickly understand it through the graph view, and for complex array type data, you can quickly understand it through the table view.\",\"q_support_features\":\"What features does JSON For You support?\",\"a_support_features1\":\"JSON Validation - Automatically validates when modified. Error lines will be marked, and sufficient context will be provided to help locate errors.\",\"a_support_features2\":\"JSON Formatting - Automatically formats when dragging files or pasting, even if the JSON data is invalid.\",\"a_support_features3\":\"JSON Minimization - Removes all whitespace characters, compressing the JSON data into a single line.\",\"a_support_features4\":\"JSON Escaping - Escapes JSON data by adding \\\\ characters to make it a valid string.\",\"a_support_features5\":\"JSON Unescaping - Unescapes JSON data by removing \\\\ characters to make it valid JSON.\",\"a_support_features6\":\"JSON Sorting - Recursively sorts keys but does not sort arrays; the JSON before and after sorting is semantically equal. Commonly used for comparison after sorting, allowing diffs to be grouped together for easier visual inspection.\",\"a_support_features7\":\"Display JSON Path - Clicking anywhere will show the corresponding token's JSON Pointer. Used in conjunction with the minimap, it helps quickly understand the structure of the JSON.\",\"a_support_features8\":\"CSV to JSON - Converts CSV files to JSON, supporting both header and no-header cases.\",\"a_support_features9\":\"JSON to CSV - Converts JSON arrays into CSV files.\",\"a_support_features10\":\"URL to JSON - Recursively parses a URL into JSON. If you need to compare the diff of two URLs, converting them to JSON first makes it very convenient.\",\"a_support_features11\":\"BigInt/int64 Comparison - In business development, IDs are often defined as int64, while JS's number can only accurately represent 52-bit integers. Without special handling on the front and back ends, precision can be lost. To quickly identify such differences, BigInt comparison functionality is supported.\",\"a_support_features12\":\"Word-by-Word Comparison - Sometimes two JSON data sets have only minor differences, such as two long strings that differ by only one or two words, making it difficult to visually identify the specific inconsistencies. Therefore, word-by-word comparison is supported, allowing you to easily spot the exact diffs.\",\"a_support_features13\":\"Array Diff Comparison - If two JSON arrays have differences, we generally do not need to view the diff of every single element, as there may be a lot of noise that is inconvenient for visual inspection. Therefore, a diff comparison is provided, offering a concise, human-readable difference similar to git diff.\",\"a_support_features14\":\"Text Comparison - Since text comparison is also a common requirement, support has been added to downgrade invalid JSON to text comparison (text diff), providing an experience similar to git diff.\",\"q_what_is_jq\":\"What is jq and how to use it in JSON For You?\",\"a_what_is_jq\":\"\u003cjq\u003ejq\u003c/jq\u003e is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
